      "Student":"Subject: Urgent: Unexpected Family Emergency - Request for Assignment Extension\n\n      Dear Professor [Last Name],\n\n      I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of an unexpected family emergency that requires my immediate attention. Unfortunately, this means that I will be unable to submit my assignment for [Subject Name] that is due on [Due Date].\n\n      My family is currently going through a tough time, and as much as I would like to focus on my work, the circumstances have rendered it increasingly difficult for me to concentrate effectively on my studies. I firmly believe in the importance of academic responsibility, and I value the knowledge and skills this course provides. Therefore, I'd hate to rush through the assignment and not provide work that reflects my full capabilities.\n\n      Would it be possible to extend the deadline by [Number of Days/Weeks]? I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, and I assure you that this is a very rare occurrence. I will make it a priority to complete the assignment as soon as the situation stabilizes.\n\n      I appreciate your understanding in this matter and look forward to your positive response. If necessary, I am ready to provide any additional documents or information you may require.\n\n      Best Regards,\n\n      [Your Name]\n      [Your University Email Address]\n      [Your Student ID Number]",
